# EmployeeForm
We can perform CURD operations in this form

For this we need to setup the server as the JSON file is readed using the server. In this I have used Tomcat server which is configured on 8080 port. And I am only reading the file from server using XMLHTTPRequest method which is the default method of browser.


SetUp: - 
If you are using the tomcat sever and want to run this project you just need to put the folder inside the tomcat/webapps/ROOT Folder. And in case if your folder name is not EmployeeForm then you need to update the main.js file as we have configured the location of JSON file there.
